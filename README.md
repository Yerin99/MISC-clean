# MISC-clean

This repository provides a **cleaned and executable implementation** of the ACL 2022 paper:

> *MISC: A MIxed Strategy-Aware Model Integrating COMET for Emotional Support Conversation*  
> (Tu et al., ACL 2022)

The [original github of MISC](https://github.com/morecry/MISC) released codes only via a [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QX4_QhYpoF5k-LeX6s2OfD65CdkEHo7x/view) in an unsorted form.  

This repository reorganizes the codebase, adds installation guides, and ensures reproducibility for easier research and development.
